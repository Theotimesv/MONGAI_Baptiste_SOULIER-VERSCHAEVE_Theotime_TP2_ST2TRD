# TP 2: WPF Interface

## Work
We have implemented the basic functionality requested.\
For the encryptions we have chosen 4 techniques: Binary, Hexadecimal, Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher.

As for the additional work, we have first implemented dynamic modifications to the interface:
- When the binary or hexadecimal method is selected in the ComboBox, the TextBox of the key disappears and vice versa.
- The maximum size of the inputs also changes depending on the methods.

Then, we have also added a 'Help' page which explains the different methods, conversions and gives an example.

Finally, we wrote the logs so that they appear in a .txt called "Logs.txt" in "*\bin\Debug\Logs.txt".
